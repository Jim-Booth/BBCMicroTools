<h1>Software</h1>

<p>

<hr>

<p>

The latest version of the GoSDC software is 1.05 (1 September 2014). It is
included with this guide, in

<a href="../../Software">this</a>

directory.

<p>

The files in the 'all' directory are for all versions of GoSDC. The files in
the 'mbe' and 'uni' directories are files that are different for the 'MBE' and
'UNI' version of GoSDC, respectively. Combine the files in the 'all' directory
and the relevant other directory as required.

<p>

Place the files where they need to be :

<p>

<ul>

<li>UPSDC

<p>

This file contains the GoSDC software. Copy it to the root directory of a
FAT12/16/32 formatted flash card, insert the card into GoSDC, and issue
'*SDCTool SDCUp' to start the update process. Wait for it to complete. Then
switch off your machine. And on again.

<li>SDCUP

<p>

If the contents of the flash ROM on GoSDC have become corrupted, and you can
therefore no longer issue '*SDCTool SDCUp' to restore them, you will have to
transfer this (BASIC) file to your BBC or Electron, and 'CHAIN' it.

<li>TOOLROM

<p>

If programmed into a PROM, allows access to SDCUP via the ROM filing system.

<li>storage_struct and osword_b0

<p>

These are text files. Put and read them where you want.

<li>GoSDCio.exe

<p>

This belongs on an (IBM compatible) PC running Windows XP (or any compatible
flavour). <b>NOTE</b> that you need to put a file called 'cygwin1.dll' in the
same directory as GoSDCio.exe before it will run. The quick route to obtain
'cygwin1.dll' is by visiting

<a href="http://cygwin.com/mirrors.html">the CygWin mirrors page</a>,

proceed to one of the mirrors, download e.g. (version numbers may differ
somewhat) 'release/cygwin/cygwin-1.7.9-1.tar.bz2', unpack it (e.g. with
'7-Zip'), and copy 'cygwin1.dll' out of the 'usr/bin' directory. The slow route
is installing all of CygWin.

<li>GoSDCio.unx

<p>

This belongs on an (IBM compatible) PC running x86 Linux. You may want to
rename it to 'gosdcio' once it is there.

<li>GoSDCio.mac

<p>

This belongs on an Apple Mac running Mac OS X. You may want to rename it to
'gosdcio' once it is there.

<li>Updates

<p>

This is a text file. Read it to know what changed since the last version of the
software.

</ul>

<p>

Refer to the

<a href="../Use/use.html">Use</a>

section of this manual for <i>all</i> additional information, including how to
use this software (and the files in the 'ROMs' directory).

<p>

To update your GoSDC software, see the description of 'UPSDC'.
